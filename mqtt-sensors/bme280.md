# BME280 temperature and humidity sensor

This uses the i2c interface, which needs to be enabled on the raspberry from `sudo raspi-config`

Maybe need to `sudo adduser pi i2c`, but enabling it from raspi-config might add the group already.

Also need to install i2c and SMBus related dependencies `sudo apt-get install i2c-tools libi2c-dev libffi-dev`
